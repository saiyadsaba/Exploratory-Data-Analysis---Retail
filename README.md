Initial Data Exploration:

Displays the first few rows of the dataset.
Checks the dimensions of the dataset (number of rows and columns).
Provides summary statistics of numerical columns.
Checks data types of columns and missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzes sales by region and visualizes the results in a bar chart.
Analyzes sales by category and visualizes the results in a bar chart.
Analyzes sales by sub-category and visualizes the results in a bar chart.
Analyzes profit by region and visualizes the results in a bar chart.

Analyzes profit by sub-category and visualizes the results in a bar chart.
Potential Business Problems Identified
Based on the analysis, the following potential business problems can be identified:

Low Sales in Certain Regions:

The analysis shows the total sales by region, highlighting regions with low sales.
Further investigation is required to understand the reasons behind the low performance in these regions.
Targeted marketing or sales strategies can be developed to improve sales in these regions.
Underperforming Categories:

The analysis shows the total sales and profit by category and sub-category.
Categories or sub-categories with lower sales or profit can be identified.
Strategies can be developed to improve performance in these categories or sub-categories.
By addressing these potential weak areas and business problems, the company can enhance its overall sales and profitability.
